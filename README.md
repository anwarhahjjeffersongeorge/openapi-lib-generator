# openapi-lib-generator

A tool to generate Rust libraries from OpenAPI specifications using the [OpenAPI Generator Rust code generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/rust/).

## About
It is available as a binary or library.

## Is this tool worth it?
There are other tools like this:

- [openapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi_generator)
- [openapi-client-generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi-client-generator)
- [oapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/oapi_generator) 

This differs from those by trying to generate self-updatable crates that include [cargo-make makefiles](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) so as not to have to keep using this generator. 

### Goal
Any crate generated by this generator should be mostly self-maintainable, including in its makefile all of the commands necessary to self-update to new versions as needed.

### Progress
It can indeed generate code, but there are problems with the OpenAPI Generator's Rust... So as of now, there will typically be errors in the generated code. There are PR requests pending on that repo to fix these problems, but the maintainers seem really busy.
