# openapi-lib-generator

A tool to generate Rust libraries from OpenAPI specifications using the [OpenAPI Generator Rust code generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/rust/).

## About
It is available as a binary or library.

## Is this tool worth it?
Oh, despair! But for the want of your approbation, this readme would be finished already.

Instead, it must be admitted that there are other tools like this:

- [openapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi_generator)
- [openapi-client-generator](https://crates.io/crates/openapi-client-generator)
- [oapi_generator](https://crates.io/crates/oapi_generator) 

This differs from those by trying to generate self-updatable crates that include [cargo-make makefiles](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) so as not to have to keep using this generator.
